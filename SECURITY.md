## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please send an email to the maintainers. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### What to Include

- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity

## Security Best Practices

When using this project:

1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
3. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
4. **Use HTTPS/TLS** in production
5. **Implement rate limiting** on all public endpoints
6. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server
7. **Use strong JWT secrets** (minimum 32 characters)
8. **Enable CORS** only for trusted origins
9. **Implement proper authentication** and authorization
10. **Regular security audits** of dependencies

## Known Security Considerations

### JWT Tokens
- Access tokens expire in 15 minutes
- Refresh tokens expire in 7 days
- Tokens are signed with HS256 algorithm
- Store tokens securely on the client side

### Password Security
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 10 salt rounds
- Minimum password length enforced
- No password complexity requirements (rely on length)

### Rate Limiting
- API Gateway implements rate limiting
- Default: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Adjust based on your requirements

### Database Security
- MongoDB authentication enabled
- Connection strings use environment variables
- Connection pooling limits configured

### Redis Security
- Redis authentication recommended for production
- Use Redis ACLs for fine-grained access control
- Disable dangerous commands in production

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions and documented in the CHANGELOG.

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community's efforts in responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities.
